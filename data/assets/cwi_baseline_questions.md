# AWS CWI Part A Baseline Questions

## Question 1: Definitions/Terminology (12% weighting)

**Per AWS D1.1:2025, what is the definition of "effective throat" for a fillet weld?**

A) The shortest distance from the root to the face
B) The perpendicular distance from the root to the hypotenuse
C) The leg length multiplied by 0.707
D) The actual throat measured after welding

**Answer:** B) The perpendicular distance from the root to the hypotenuse
**Reference:** AWS D1.1:2025, Section 2.1 Definitions
**Explanation:** Effective throat is the minimum distance minus any convexity from the joint root to the weld face of a fillet weld.

## Question 2: Welding Processes (10% weighting)

**Which AWS D1.1:2025 prequalified welding process requires backing for complete joint penetration groove welds?**

A) SMAW in all positions
B) GMAW with spray transfer only
C) SAW from one side only
D) FCAW-G in vertical position

**Answer:** C) SAW from one side only
**Reference:** AWS D1.1:2025, Table 3.1
**Explanation:** SAW requires backing when welding from one side to ensure complete penetration.

## Question 4: Welding Symbols (10% weighting)

**This welding symbol indicates a 1/4" fillet weld. Where is the size shown?**

A) To the left of the symbol
B) To the right of the symbol
C) Above the reference line
D) Below the reference line

**Answer:** A) To the left of the symbol
**Reference:** AWS A2.4:2020, Section 3
**Explanation:** Fillet weld size is always shown to the left of the weld symbol.
