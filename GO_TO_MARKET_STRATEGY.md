## ðŸŽ¤ LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT TEMPLATES

### **LinkedIn Post (Launch Day)**

```
ðŸŽ‰ Launching WeldTrack Professional today!

After 6 months of development and 10 beta testers, I'm excited to 
share WeldTrack - a focused CWI exam prep platform built for welding 
inspectors, by welding inspectors.

What it does:
âœ… 200+ AWS D1.1:2025 practice questions
âœ… Structured learning modules (Code application, not just theory)
âœ… Progress tracking and analytics
âœ… Mobile-friendly (practice anywhere)
âœ… 7-day free trial

Why I built it:
The CWI exam has a 60% failure rate. Retakes cost $250+. Most study 
materials are expensive ($1,500 seminars) or outdated.

I wanted affordable, current, practical prep that actually works.

Try it free: [Link to /pricing]

### **Reddit Post (r/Welding)**

```
Title: I built a CWI exam prep tool - looking for feedback

Hey r/welding,

I recently passed my CWI exam and during my prep I couldn't find 
affordable, up-to-date practice materials that weren't just PDFs 
or $1,500 seminars.

So I built WeldTrack - a web app with 200+ AWS D1.1:2025 practice 
questions and structured modules.

Features:
- Realistic exam-format questions
- Instant feedback with code references
- Progress tracking
- Mobile-friendly

It's live now with a 7-day free trial: [Link]

I'm looking for honest feedback from anyone studying for CWI or 
teaching welding inspection. What works? What doesn't? What's missing?

Happy to answer any questions!
