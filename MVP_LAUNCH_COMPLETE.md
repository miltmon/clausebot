## ðŸŽ“ LESSONS LEARNED & BEST PRACTICES

### **What Worked**

1. **Pragmatic MVP Scoping**
   - Focused on monetization first (not feature bloat)
   - Built only what's needed to accept payments
   - Validated with test transactions before scaling

2. **Infrastructure-as-Code**
   - Render Blueprint makes deployment repeatable
   - Environment variables centralized
   - One-click rollback capability

3. **Webhook Automation**
   - Zero manual intervention for subscription lifecycle
   - Database automatically syncs with Stripe
   - Pro access granted/revoked automatically

4. **Content Gating at Database Level**
   - Not just UI hiding (secure)
   - Stripe webhook directly controls access
   - No way to bypass paywall

### **What to Avoid**

1. **Don't Build More Features Yet**
   - Get 10 paying customers first
   - Validate demand before scaling content
   - Iterate based on real feedback, not assumptions

2. **Don't Obsess Over Polish**
   - Perfect is the enemy of shipped
   - First customers will be forgiving (beta users)
   - Fix bugs as they're reported

3. **Don't Skip Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts NOW (before first customer)
   - Check webhook logs daily (first week)
   - Monitor Stripe dashboard for payment issues

4. **Don't Neglect Customer Success**
