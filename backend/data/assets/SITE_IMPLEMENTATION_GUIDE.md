# Site Implementation Guide
**Transform Your Site from Promises to Professional Reality**

## 🚀 Immediate Impact Actions

### Day 1: Critical CTA Updates
Replace all "7-day trial" buttons with waitlist CTAs:

```html
<!-- OLD: -->
<a href="/trial">Start 7-Day Trial</a>

<!-- NEW: -->
<a href="/waitlist">Join Early Access Waitlist</a>
```

### Day 1: Fix Broken Links
Update all broken external CTAs:
- `manus.im/partner-proposal` → `/partner-solutions`
- `manus.im/onboarding` → `/support` (temporary) or `/onboarding` (when ready)
- Any trial-related CTAs → `/waitlist`

## 📁 Files Ready to Deploy

### Core Pages (Copy to your site root)
```
pages/
├── waitlist.html              # Early access signup (replaces trial CTAs)
├── support.html               # SLA, contact info, FAQs
├── partner-solutions.html     # Partner intake form
├── foundation.html            # Program overview
└── foundation-module-1.html   # Full lesson + interactive quiz
```

### Data Assets
```
data/
└── cwi_partA_question_bank.csv  # 60+ CWI Part A questions with explanations
```

## 🔧 Implementation Instructions

### 1. Core Navigation Updates
Add these links to your main navigation:
```html
<nav>
  <a href="/foundation">Foundation Track</a>
  <a href="/partner-solutions">Partners</a>
  <a href="/support">Support</a>
</nav>
```

### 2. Footer Updates
Replace your footer with support contact info from `support.html`:
```html
<footer>
  <div class="support-info">
    <p>📧 support@miltmonndt.com | 📞 1-800-CLAUSE-1</p>
    <p>99.5% uptime guarantee • 30-day money-back guarantee</p>
  </div>
</footer>
```

### 3. Waitlist Integration
The waitlist form in `waitlist.html` needs backend integration:
```javascript
// Add to waitlist.html form submission
fetch('/api/waitlist', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: formData.get('email'),
    name: formData.get('name'),
    useCase: formData.get('use-case'),
    company: formData.get('company')
  })
});
```

### 4. Foundation Module Integration
The interactive lesson in `foundation-module-1.html` includes:
- ✅ Complete lesson content
- ✅ 15-question interactive quiz with timer
- ✅ Automatic scoring and feedback
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Mobile responsive design

No backend required - works standalone!

### 5. CWI Question Bank Usage
Import `cwi_partA_question_bank.csv` into your quiz system:
```csv
domain,question,option_a,option_b,option_c,option_d,answer,explanation,reference_hint
```
