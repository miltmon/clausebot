## Lesson 6.2 (≤10 min) — Code Navigation Mastery

**Objectives**

* Master rapid code navigation techniques.
* Use effective search and lookup strategies.

**Script**

* **Four-step navigation:** TOC → likely clause → index keyword → confirm with figures/tables notes. *(verify)*
* **PDF tactics:** Bookmarks, exact phrase search, wildcards; physical tactics (tabs, margin cues per exam rules). *(verify)*
* **One-line call format:** *Clause/Table → value/limit → condition notes* for Part C answers. *(verify)*

**Micro-drill (timed lookup x5)**

* Instructor gives five prompts (e.g., *undercut limit, static fillet*). Learner records clause/table + answer in ≤90s each. *(verify in D1.1)*
* **Term disambiguation:** EV vs SEV vs NEV; P-, F-, A-numbers. *(verify in ASME IX)*

---

## Lesson 6.3 (≤10 min) — Part B Practical Tactics

**Objectives**

* Execute systematic Part B measurement routine.
* Apply BOS requirements correctly.

**Script**

* **BOS is exam-specific:** Treat as governing spec (not your day-job code). *(verify in BOS)*
* **10-minute routine:** Scope → Find Rule → Measure → Disposition → Ethics pulse. *(verify)*
* **Tool micro-checks:** Zeroing, two readings, worst-case comparison. *(verify)*

**Micro-drill (mini-specimen)**

* Given a replica photo & measurements, draft the one-line disposition with BOS anchor. *(verify)*
* **Gauge sanity:** Identify which tool for each feature (reinforcement, undercut, misalignment). *(verify)*

---

## Lesson 6.4 (≤10 min) — Traps, Ethics, and Exam Operations

**Objectives**

* Avoid common exam traps and maintain ethical standards.
* Manage time and exam operations effectively.

**Script**

* **Common traps:** Wrong code edition, ignoring footnotes, mixing processes/transfer modes, assuming prequalification, misusing calculator. *(verify)*
* **Ethics under pressure:** Impartial calls, documentation language, escalation paths. *(verify QC1/B5.1)*
* **Exam operations:** Time boxing, flag-and-return, "last 5 minutes = clause checks." *(verify)*

**Micro-drill (trap hunt)**

* 5 short stems; circle the trap (e.g., missing footnote) and correct it. *(verify)*
* **Ethics pulse:** Write a neutral, audit-safe note for a pressured borderline call. *(verify)*

## Quiz (10 MCQs with rationales)

1. **Part C best first move when stem cites an acceptance limit but no clause?**
   A) TOC → fabrication chapter → scan tables  B) **Index the exact term, then confirm table notes**  C) Search figures only  D) Jump to annexes
   **Answer:** B — Index surfaces candidate clauses fast; confirm footnotes/notes prevent trap answers. *(verify D1.1)*

2. **A welder qualified on GMAW spray is assigned short-circuiting production. Under D1.1, you should:**
   A) Allow—same process family  B) Allow if amperage matches  C) **Requalify for short-circuiting mode**  D) Deny all GMAW work
   **Answer:** C — D1.1 treats GMAW-S separately for performance; transfer mode is an essential change. *(verify Table 6.12)*

3. **Part B measurement order to minimize re-work of readings:**
   A) Disposition → Measure → Find Rule  B) Measure → Disposition → Find Rule  C) **Find Rule → Measure → Disposition**  D) Measure → Find Rule → Disposition
   **Answer:** C — Rule first prevents measuring the wrong feature; then compare; then call. *(verify BOS)*

4. **ASME IX: Which change most likely triggers welder requalification?**
   A) Travel speed tweak within WPS range  B) Switch from F-4 to F-3 electrode  C) **From vertical up to vertical down progression**  D) Increasing stringer count
   **Answer:** C — Progression direction is essential for performance qualification. *(verify QW-405.3)*

5. **D1.1 Prequalification: Which is *not* prequalified without testing?**
   A) SMAW  B) FCAW  C) SAW  D) **GMAW short-circuiting**
   **Answer:** D — GMAW-S is excluded from prequalified WPSs. *(verify Clause 5)*

6. **Best ethical response when QC asks you to "go easy" on borderline undercut during exam sim:**
   A) Accept; production needs it  B) Hold; schedule a later review  C) **Reject/Accept strictly per rule and document neutral rationale**  D) Ask welder's opinion
   **Answer:** C — Impartial, code-anchored call with defensible note. *(verify QC1)*

7. **Part C time strategy with 46 items/≈2 hr:**
   A) Linear answering only  B) **2-pass: quick wins → flagged returns**  C) Start with the hardest  D) 10 min per question
   **Answer:** B — Two-pass improves coverage; use flags and clause checks. *(verify exam advice)*

8. **You find a D1.1 value that conflicts with memory from ASME IX. You should:**
   A) Use memory—experience counts  B) Ask a proctor  C) **Use the cited code for that part and document anchor**  D) Average both values
   **Answer:** C — Part C grades against chosen code edition; anchor to it. *(verify)*

9. **PAUT appears in your contract docs for a structural weld. Your Part C tactic is to:**
   A) Ignore—too advanced  B) **Cite Annex H requirements and Engineer approval conditions**  C) Use RT limits instead  D) Quote Section V only
   **Answer:** B — D1.1 includes normative PAUT annex; Engineer may specify. *(verify Annex H / Clause 8)*

10. **Calculator policy (typical, verify current rules):**
    A) Any programmable is fine  B) Phone calculators allowed in airplane mode  C) **Simple non-programmable, quiet; bring backup**  D) None allowed
    **Answer:** C — Most policies allow simple calculators; verify current AWS instructions. *(verify)*

*(Each rationale in your LMS should end with "(verify in code)" and avoid quoting.)*

## Instructor crib (one-liners to model)

* **Accept** — *Part B measurement follows BOS routine with proper tool checks and defensible disposition. (verify)*
* **Reject** — *Code navigation skips index confirmation; leads to wrong clause and trap answers. (verify)*
* **Hold** — *Ethics scenario lacks neutral documentation; revise for audit-safe language per QC1. (verify)*
