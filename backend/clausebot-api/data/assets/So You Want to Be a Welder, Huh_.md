# 1. What Is Welding?

Welding is the process of joining materials, (usually metals or thermoplastics), by means of heat, pressure, or both. This simple act forms the foundations of buildings, bridges, vehicles, and so much more.

# 2. The Skills Every Welder Needs

- **Attention to Detail**
- **Manual Dexterity**
- **Spatial Reasoning**
- **Reading Technical Drawings**
- **Understanding Codes and Standards**
<!-- IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER: Infographic showing hands-on and mind-on skills needed for welding work -->

***

# 3. Safety First: PPE and Shop Hazards

Welding can be dangerous. Every welder must master safety protocols.

- Helmet with correct filter lens
- Gloves and flame-resistant clothing
- Hearing and respiratory protection
- Fire safety and fume extraction
<!-- IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER: Diagram labeling every required piece of PPE on a welder; Chart of common shop hazards and simple mitigation tips -->

***

# 4. Welding Processes Explained

- **Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW):** ‘Stick welding,’ versatile and common.
- **Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW):** ‘MIG welding,’ fast for production work.
- **Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW):** High deposition, outdoor-friendly.
- **Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW):** ‘TIG welding,’ fine precision.
- **Other processes:** SAW, OAW, spot welding.

# 5. Setting Up Your Shop

Before striking an arc, you need a safe, organized environment.

- Position your welding machine for access and ventilation
- Store electrodes/wire dry and secure
- Have fire suppression nearby
<!-- IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER: Floor plan diagram of an ideal small welding shop setup, showing machine placement, PPE station, material racks -->

***

# 6. Metal Types \& Preparation

- **Steel—mild, carbon, stainless**
- **Aluminum**
- **Cast iron**
Prepping your metal: clean, degrease, and use a grinder for a proper surface.
<!-- IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER: Images of different metals and a stepwise pictorial of prep/clean procedures -->

***

# 7. Welding Joints \& Positions

Types of joints:

- Butt
- Lap
- Tee
- Corner
- Edge
Welding positions:
- Flat (1F/1G)
- Horizontal (2F/2G)
- Vertical (3F/3G)
- Overhead (4F/4G)
<!-- IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER: Diagram of joint types and welding positions, with real weld photo examples -->

***

# 8. Making Your First Weld: Step-by-Step

1. Set the amperage/wire speed
2. Strike the arc
3. Maintain correct travel speed/angle
4. Observe puddle shape, bead consistency
5. Terminate correctly
<!-- IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER: Step-by-step photo series; overlay arrows showing torch angle, travel speed; sample finished beads -->

***

# 9. Common Weld Defects \& How to Fix Them

Typical defects:

- Undercut
- Porosity
- Incomplete fusion
- Cracks
- Overlap
How to fix:
- Adjust settings (heat, speed)
- Clean metal better
- Use proper technique
Color code:
- **Red = Reject**
- **Yellow = Measure/Check**
- **Green = Accept**
<!-- IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER: Photo chart of weld defects with color-coded overlays and ‘fix it’ tip boxes -->

***

# 10. Inspecting Welds: Tools \& Techniques

Tools:

- Fillet gauges
- Pit gauges
- Micrometers
- Magnifiers
Techniques:
- Visual inspection (first and always)
- Magnetic particle, dye penetrant, ultrasonic, radiographic
<!-- IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER: Image set—weld inspector with typical tools, and sample NDT test setups (paint, yoke, probe) -->

***

# 11. Visual Learning—Using Diagrams for Memory

- Diagrams improve retention by 40% compared to text alone.
- Visual associations: Pair a shape or color to each defect/type for faster recall.
Practice: Sketch joints, mark up defects, color-code acceptance.
<!-- IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER: Example visual mnemonics, flash cards, quick-reference diagram chart for exam day -->

***

# 12. Becoming a Certified Welding Inspector: The CWI Path

- Education and experience requirements
- Three-part exam: Fundamentals (A), Practical (B), Code Book (C)
- Use visual study guides, practice with photo-based questions
<!-- IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER: Flowchart of CWI career path and sample CWI exam screens/photos -->

***

# 13. Study Tips, Practice, and Exam Day Prep

Study visually:

- Work through real weld photos and defect galleries
- Diagram measurement techniques, NDT setups
- Use sample exams with color-coded criteria
Exam day:
- Review visual quick charts
- Rest, hydrate, use relaxation techniques
<!-- IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER: Checklist and visual schedule for exam day; sample exam question with diagram -->
