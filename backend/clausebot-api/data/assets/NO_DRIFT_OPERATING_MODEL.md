# NO-DRIFT OPERATING MODEL
## 7-Day SLA Framework for Standards Compliance

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **MISSION STATEMENT**

**Prevent training content from becoming stale, inaccurate, or non-compliant with current industry standards through systematic edition control, field validation, and platform reliability.**

---

## ðŸ“‹ **OPERATING PRINCIPLES**

### **1. Edition Control (Zero Tolerance for Stale Content)**
- **Rule**: No content ships with outdated standard references
- **SLA**: 7 calendar days to review and update after edition change
- **Gate**: Publication blocked until all edition alerts cleared

### **2. Field Validation (Realism Over Theory)**
- **Rule**: All scenarios must reflect actual job site conditions
- **SLA**: Quarterly refresh with 20+ new scenarios per track
- **Gate**: Zero-tolerance for safety-critical content without dual sign-off

### **3. Platform Reliability (Offline-First, Fast Recovery)**
- **Rule**: Learning never stops due to technical issues
- **SLA**: <3s page load, offline capability, <5min rollback time
- **Gate**: All content must pass mobile + low-connectivity testing

## ðŸ”„ **PROCESSES & WORKFLOWS**

### **Edition Change Process**

**Day 0: Edition Release**
1. Regulatory Liaison receives official announcement
2. Update `code_editions` table: set new edition as `is_current = true`
3. System automatically creates `edition_alerts` for all affected content
4. Email notification sent to all module owners
5. Publication gates activated for affected content

**Day 1-7: Review & Update**
1. Module owners receive alert notifications
2. Review content against new edition requirements
3. Update content references and clause citations
4. Run ClauseBot quality gate
5. Mark alerts as "in_progress" â†’ "cleared"
6. Sign QC approval

**Day 7: SLA Check**
1. System checks for unresolved alerts
2. Overdue alerts escalated to management
3. Content remains blocked until cleared
4. Compliance report generated

**Escalation Path:**
- Day 3: Reminder email to module owner
- Day 5: CC management on reminder
- Day 7: Management escalation + content deprecation

### **Scenario Intake Process**

**Submission (Continuous)**
1. Field practitioners submit scenarios via intake form
2. System validates consent and required fields
3. Image uploads stored in secure storage
4. Submission marked as "pending" status

**Review (Monthly)**
1. Advisory board meets monthly
2. Review all pending submissions
3. Rate safety criticality (1-5 scale)
4. Approve/reject/request revision
5. Approved scenarios integrated into training

**Integration (Quarterly)**
1. Approved scenarios added to question banks
2. Content updated with new field examples
3. Old scenarios archived or updated
4. Training materials refreshed

### **Quality Gate Process**

**Pre-Release Testing**
1. Content passes edition verification
2. Mobile responsiveness test (375px+)
3. Offline functionality test
4. Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)
5. ClauseBot accuracy validation
6. Performance test (<3s load time)

**Release Approval**
1. QA Lead signs off on testing
2. Module owner provides final QC
3. Publication gates released
4. Content goes live

**Post-Release Monitoring**
1. Sentry error monitoring active
2. User feedback collection
3. Performance metrics tracking
4. Rollback procedures ready
