# CWI Part A Sample Question - Proper Format

## Question 1: Definitions/Terminology (4 points)

**Scenario:** A CWI is reviewing welding symbols on structural drawings for a building project using AWS D1.1:2025.

**Question:** According to AWS D1.1:2025, what is the definition of "effective area" for a fillet weld?

A) The cross-sectional area of the weld metal
B) The area of the largest inscribed triangle
C) The throat area calculated using 0.707 times leg length
D) The total fusion zone area including base metal

---

## Answer Key:

**Correct Answer:** C

**Primary Reference:** AWS D1.1:2025, Section 2.1, Definitions

**Explanation:**
The effective area of a fillet weld is defined as the product of the effective throat and the length of the weld. For equal leg fillet welds, the effective throat = 0.707 Ã— leg length.

**Why other answers are incorrect:**
- A) Cross-sectional area is too broad and includes base metal
- B) Inscribed triangle method is for throat measurement, not area calculation
- D) Fusion zone includes base metal, not just effective weld area

**Related Code Sections:**
- AWS D1.1:2025, Table 2.3 (Effective Area Calculations)
- AWS D1.1:2025, Section 5.15 (Fillet Weld Requirements)
