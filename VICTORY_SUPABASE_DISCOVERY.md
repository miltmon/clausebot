## 🚀 **Launch Strategy Decision**

### **Recommended: Parallel Systems**

**Use BOTH deployments:**

1. **Lovable (Primary) - Nov 10 Launch**
   - ✅ Already working
   - ✅ Revenue system operational
   - ✅ No risk, use as-is

2. **GitHub/Vercel (Secondary) - Post-Launch**
   - Configure to use correct Supabase
   - Test thoroughly
   - Migrate when ready

**This approach:**
- ✅ **Zero risk** to Nov 10 launch
- ✅ **Proven system** goes live
- ✅ **New deployment** ready as backup
- ✅ **Smooth migration** when comfortable
