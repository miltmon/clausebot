FROM users
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Check trial conversions
SELECT 
  subscription_status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - created_at))/86400), 1) as avg_days_since_signup

## ðŸ†˜ TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Issue: Webhook not firing**
```
1. Check Stripe Dashboard â†’ Webhooks â†’ Event logs
2. Verify webhook URL is correct (https://clausebot.vercel.app/api/stripe-webhook)
3. Check webhook secret in Vercel matches Stripe
4. Look for errors in Vercel function logs
5. Test webhook manually in Stripe dashboard ("Send test webhook")
```

**Issue: Pro access not granted after payment**
```
1. Check webhook delivered successfully in Stripe
2. Check Supabase users table - is record created?
3. Look at user's email - does it match checkout email?
4. Check has_pro_access column value
5. Try manual update: UPDATE users SET has_pro_access = true WHERE email = 'user@email.com'
```

**Issue: Trial not counting down**
```
1. Check trial_ends_at timestamp in Supabase
2. Verify dashboard is reading correct field
3. Check timezone conversions (should be UTC in database)
```

**Issue: Payment failing**
```
1. Check Stripe Dashboard â†’ Payments for decline reason
2. Common reasons: Insufficient funds, card declined, fraud detection
3. Stripe sends email to customer automatically
4. You can retry payment in Stripe dashboard
```

**Issue: Customer can't access dashboard**
```
1. Check if email is in localStorage (success page should set it)
2. Verify Supabase RLS policies allow read access
3. Check CORS settings on Supabase API
4. Look at browser console for errors
```
